SpriteDragger
=============

A clean, minimal Cocos2D iPhone example project showing you how to drag a sprite around the screen.

Topics covered in the source code:

 * Creating a minimal App Delegate class to handle creating the window, the GL view and initialize Cocos2D iPhone
 * Receiving ccTouch events from Cocos2D and translating them into dragging a CCSprite
 * Animating the sprite via runAction
 * CCDirector, CCScene, CCSprite, CCColorLayer, CCSequence, CCScaleBy

Notes:

 * Includes an example Xcode project.
 * Uses Cocos2d-iPhone version 1.0.1
 * Project is purposefully non-ARC
